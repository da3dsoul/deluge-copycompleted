deluge-copycompleted
====================

This plugin for [Deluge][1] copies downloaded files to another location.

Move to and Label options added from other forks.

Fixed for python3.8 / Deluge2

It works fine for me, but if there are any issues, feel free to drop me an
email at illustriousdreamer@gmail.com.
